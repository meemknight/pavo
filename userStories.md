Linux C/C++ debugger named **pavo** wich needs to launch, halt, and continue execution. Also, a very recomended property is to 
set breakpoints on memory addresses, on source code lines and on function entries. It will be great for pavo to read and write registers
and memory. The platform should have single stepping (instruction, step in, step out, step over) and it is nice to have the ability to
print current source location, print backtrace and print values of simple variables.
A GUI would be well recieved along with the CLI.

Altought pavo is already a very complex program, the next quirks will really help it to stand out: Windows compatibility is a very well
recieved feature and a multy-language interface is very appreciated.
